This application allows you to use the official Sony PS3 Bluetooth remote
control (and other compatible remotes) within windows. The remote simulates
a keyboard whereby each button can be assigned one or many keyboard keys.
When you press a key on the remote, the application simulates the keyboard
key pressses.


=====================

INSTALLATION:

    1. Download and install the PS3BluMote application from: 
       http://benbarron.com/applications.
    2. Pair the remote (see instructions below).
    3. Open the PS3BluMote application. The icon for the application will
       appear in the system tray. A gray icon means the remote is not
       connected; blue means connected.
    4. Right-click on the system tray icon and click "Settings". Here
       you can change all the settings needed and the key assignments. You
       can close this window by clicking the "X" in the top right-hand
       corner. You settings will autoamtically be saved.    
    5. To exit the application you will need to right-click on the system

HOW TO PAIR THE OFFICIAL SONY PS3 BLUETOOTH REMOTE IN WINDOWS:

    1. Bring up the Bluetooth pairing screen on your computer.
    2. Put the PS3 Bluetooth Remote into pairing mode. To do this you hold 
      "Start+Enter" buttons for 5 seconds and then release.
    3. Search for discoverable devices on your computer.
    4. When the remote is found, pair the device. If prompted for a key, opt
       for the NO KEY option.
    5. Allow for the device to pair. Do NOT close the "finished paring screen"
       for 2 minutes. Hopefully it should install some drivers in the
       background (see your system tray).
    6. Open the PS3BluMote application and see if the remote works, pressing
       any button should pair the remote automatically. If it works you will
       have a blue icon in your system tray and when you hover over the icon
       for the application it will popup with "Connected".
       
If it does not work, continue with these steps:

    7. Put the remote back into pairing mode (follow instruction 2).
    8. Open up the services screen for the already paired remote.
    9. **HOPEFULLY** you should see a checkbox for HID device (or something 
       similar). Check it and click Apply/Ok and it should install the driver.
       
If you are still having issues continue with these steps:

   10. Unplug your PS3 (if you own one).
   11. Unpair/Remove any PS3 related Bluetooth devices that are paired with
       your computer.
   12. Remove the drivers for your PC Bluetooth device/dongle and remove the 
       actual device itself.
   13. Look through Device Manager to ensure that all drivers/devices related
       to Bluetooth have been removed.
   14. Restart your computer.
   15. Plug the Bluetooth device/dongle back into your PC and install the 
       drivers.
   16. Restart your computer.
   17. Return to Step 1.
